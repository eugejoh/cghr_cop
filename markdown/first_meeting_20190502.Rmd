Kick off first of (hopefully) more R and data-related tutorials. Looking at the title, but I think it will be more appropriate to call these "meeting" our community of practice. CoP is something I'll discuss a bit further today.

So you might ask, we call it a CoP or create one?

The bottom line is that these meetings will be a place where we can informally share useful information, ask and answer questions together (there is no such thing as a dumb question), basic respect for one another.

And the reason why I personally think that CoP are beneficial for a group is that there is power in collaboration and sharing of resources. 

It's not fun to learn how to code alone and this tweet from the R community on Twitter sums up what the learning process can look like and be. 

So this is an invitation to bring your questions and insights to these meetings!

## CoP Structure

.large[
1. Meet for 50 minutes  
2. Presentation/tutorial of a useful tool (30min)  
3. Open discussion (20min)  
]


???
So for the future sessions, we'll try to meet for around an hour. 

The typical format will be an informal presentation by someone on a useful tip, tool, package, whatever it will be for 30 minutes

Then the rest of the time will be open discussion - people can bring questions, share ideas/functions/packages, discuss current data problems/concerns. 

This format is not concrete and we can play it by ear moving forward.

**Proficiency and Goals...**
 1. Data Analysis

These were the results of the survey - N = 6. Excel, Stata and R were the most used tools for data related tasks. 

From the top uses, challenges, and goals - **data visualization** and **data analysis** were the most frequently mentioned.

# Data Management

## Data Management

Document a **minimum amount** of information about our data

 1. Description  
 2. Source  
 3. Date Updated  
 4. Date Acquired  
 5. Person who obtained the data
 
<br>
 
--
This can all be stored in a **README** file or document

???
So data management is important because when you don't do it, it will bite you back in an year or two when you don't remember all the details regarding the data.

So following the "good enough" principles, we should be documenting these 5 things listed below.

brief description of the dataset
where you obtained the data, the source(website, MoU, collaborator)
how recent is the data or when was the last time the data were updated
when you actually obtained or downloaded the data
who actually got the data...

this can all be stored in a readme file or document

---

# Data Processing
### Objectives:
1. Reshape data from wide to long format  
2. Specify data types  
3. Filter for 2007 to 2017 period  
4. Filter for certain countries  

<br>
--
.large[How can we do this in R?] 
--
.large[**More packages!**]
--
```{r message=FALSE}
# part of the tidyverse
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

???
our objectives to answer the research question on the trends of malaria deaths, we can to do the following.

1. reshape the data... for those Stata users you are very aware of what this entails
2. specify data types if any are wrong
3. filter for the time period we were interested in
4. filter for the countries of interest

---
class: animate, fadeIn, faster
## 1. Reshape Data
We want to "gather" all the columns (2000, 2001, ..., 2017) into a single `Year` column
<br>
--
<br>
We can use `gather` from the `tidyr` package!
--
```{r}
l_data <- gather(my_data, "Year", "Deaths", -"Country")
```
--
```{r}
head(l_data, 3) #sanity check 1
dim(l_data) #old dim() was 105 19
```

???
check dims 18*105 = 1890

---
class: animate, fadeIn, faster
## 2. Data Types
First we'll check the data types for each column

--
```{r}
head(l_data, 3)
```

--

`Year` seems to be a `character` type, so we need to switch to `numeric` type...

---
class: animate, fadeIn, faster
## 2. Data Types

We want to "change" the `Year` column to a `numeric` data type
<br>
--
<br>
We can use `mutate` from the `dplyr` package!
--
```{r}
l_data <- mutate(l_data, Year = as.numeric(Year))
```
--
```{r}
head(l_data, 3)
```

???
if you notice we're assigning the output of the mutate to `l_data` again, this is just means that we're updating or reassigning `l_data` in our function.

we look at the `l_data` we just assigned and now it's a numeric "double" type

---
class: animate, fadeIn, faster
## 3. Filter Years
Next we want to "filter" years from 2007 and up
<br>
--
<br>
We can use `filter` from the `dplyr` package!
--
```{r}
range(l_data$Year) #range of years
```
--
```{r}
l_data <- filter(l_data, Year >= 2007)
```
--
```{r}
range(l_data$Year) #sanity check 2
```

???
the range in the original data is from 2000 to 2017

"we want to filter our data frame `l_data` for only years that are greater than or equal to 2007"

sanity check

---
class: animate, fadeIn, faster
## 4. Filter Countries
And finally "filter" the countries we want
--
```{r eval=FALSE}
l_data <- filter(l_data, Country == "Sierra Leone" & Country == "Mozambique" & Country == "Ethiopia" & Country == "India")
```
--
```{r}
my_countries <- c("Sierra Leone", "Mozambique", "Ethiopia", "India")
l_data <- filter(l_data, Country %in% my_countries)
```

--
```{r echo=FALSE}
l_data
```

???
we can declare the conditions for each country... you might think, this is cumbersome what if I wanted to filter for 20 countries?

we can do that creating a vector of countries we want called `my_countries` and we can use the %in% operator to return the same logic conditions as above to filter our data

---
class: animate, fadeIn, faster
## Chain Multiple Steps

You can chain all the processing together using the pipe operator `%>%`!
--
.pull-left[
```{r}
# with piping!
l_data_pipe <- my_data %>% 
  gather("Year", "Deaths", -"Country") %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year)) %>% 
  filter(Year >= 2007) %>% 
  filter(Country %in% my_countries)
```
```{r}
# `l_data` is the non-pipe method
identical(l_data, l_data_pipe)
```
]

???
so we accomplished all the processing in separate steps or lines of code. `dplyr` contains a pipe operator that allows to chain multiple functions together and make it really easy to write and read the code that does all the processing!

When I first learned about this, it literally blew my mind and has made it easier for me to read and understand my own code

open link and show density plots

a good visualization can really send a message to the audience and I think Hans Rosling did that when we visualized the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita over time.

and this animation was created using the gganimate package
